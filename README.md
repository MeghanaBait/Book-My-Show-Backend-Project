# Book My Show API-SpringBoot_BackEnd

This project is a Spring Boot implementation of the backend APIs for a ticket booking system, similar to the popular platform "BookMyShow." It provides a set of RESTful APIs that enable client applications to interact with the ticket booking system and perform various operations. This project allows users to browse available movies, select shows, and reserve tickets. In addition, the system keeps track of booking history, providing users with details of their past Bookings. To enhance user experience, email notifications are sent for successful bookings and important updates, ensuring users stay informed and engaged.
